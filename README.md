# Node Project Template
> Template for Node.js projects


## Purpose

Why does this project exist? Because I'm tired of running npm init and starting from scratch each time when I know mostly what my git configs, package.json details and docs will look like. So now I just use this as a starting point.

For Python projects, see also [py-project-template](https://github.com/MichaelCurrin/py-project-template)
