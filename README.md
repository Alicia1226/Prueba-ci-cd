## About

This is a template project for new JavaScript projects, whether making a frontend app, server-side app or CLI tool.

### How to use this project

1. Click _Use this template_ button at the top.
2. Follow the install and run instructions in [docs](/docs/) to get the basic app up and running.
3. Follow the [Customization](/docs/customization.md) instructions to make it your own.

### Purpose

Why does this project exist? I'm tired of running `git init` and `npm init` and starting with an empty repo each time.  I know mostly what my git configs, `package.json` details and docs will look like and I don't want to have to type from memory or copy and paste - I want to get to the core code.

So now I just use this repo as a starting point and reference, to make new projects faster to setup and also to keep them consistent.

This project is deliberately open-ended so you can make choices about your own NPM commands and test framework. The only dependency here is _ESLint_.

For Python projects, see also [py-project-template](https://github.com/MichaelCurrin/py-project-template).
